I am currently a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Saskatchewan, working at the intersection of Quantum Computing and Bioinformatics. Under the co-supervision of Dr. Lingling Jin and Dr. Steven Rayan, my research focuses on applying quantum algorithms to solve complex problems in biological data analysis and computational genomics.

My academic journey spans multiple disciplines. I hold a Master of Science in Computer Science (2024â€“2025, expected), and a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Computer Science, both from the University of Saskatchewan. Prior to transitioning into computer science, I earned an M.Sc. in Socio-Economic Systems Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, and a B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics from Shahed University.
